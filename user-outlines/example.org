dependencies. Having the following includes is probably not optional for now.

#+include: "../nougat/package-management/straight.org::use-package integration"

* badger-theme
This is a nice looking theme to get you going. Change it to whatever you want!

  (use-package badger-theme
    :config (load-theme 'badger t))
#+end_src

* emacs

#+include: "../nougat/emacs/cursor.org::blinking"

* org-mode

* projectile
Who doesn't want Projectile?
#+include: "../nougat/packages/projectile/setup.org"
#+include: "../nougat/packages/projectile/discover-projects.org"
Tell discover-projects.org where to find your projects.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq projectile-project-directory (expand-file-name "~/Projects"))
#+end_src
