* YASnippet
YASnippet extends org-mode '<s'-like templating in an arbitrary way.
This is useful for quickly applying export settings, annotating code blocks, and the like. 

This assumes that snippets are stored or symlinked to =${HOME}/.emacs.d/snippets/*=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package yasnippet)
(setq yas-snippet-dirs
      '("~/.emacs.d/snippets"                 ;; personal snippets
;;        "/path/to/some/collection/"           ;; foo-mode and bar-mode snippet collection
;;        "/path/to/yasnippet/yasmate/snippets" ;; the yasmate collection
        ))

(yas-global-mode 1) ;; or M-x yas-reload-all if you've started YASnippet already.
(setq yas-triggers-in-field t) ;; allow nested snippets
